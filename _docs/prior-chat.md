## Areas for Improvement

We've identified several areas that need attention to ensure complete conformance with the style guide and technical requirements:

1. **Global CSS Integration**
   - The globals.css file needs to be properly integrated into the project structure
   - It should be moved to the correct location and imported in the layout.tsx file
   - CSS variables should be consistently applied across all components

2. **Font Configuration**
   - Fonts need to be properly loaded via Next.js font optimization
   - Font fallbacks should be configured correctly
   - Typography should be consistent across all components and themes

3. **Component Library Consistency**
   - All components should follow the same pattern and style
   - New components should be created following the established patterns
   - Documentation should be added for all components

4. **Theme Toggle Integration**
   - The theme toggle should be added to the header component
   - Theme changes should be reflected immediately across the application
   - Theme preferences should be synced with user profiles in the database

## Next Steps

In our next session, we will focus on addressing these areas for improvement to ensure complete conformance with the style guide and technical requirements. Specifically, we will:

1. Properly integrate the globals.css file into the project structure
2. Configure font loading via Next.js font optimization
3. Ensure component library consistency
4. Integrate the theme toggle into the header component
5. Sync theme preferences with user profiles
