# Context for YPO SF Gold Chapter Management Platform

## Project Background
The Young Presidents' Organization (YPO) SF Gold Chapter needs a centralized web platform to serve as a hub for chapter information and communication. Currently, they use disparate tools like email, WhatsApp, and Chapter Pro (a clunky platform serving 200+ chapters). The goal is to create a 20x better UX with a custom platform focused solely on their chapter's needs.

## User Base
- ~100 members (chapter participants)
- ~100 spouses (similar access as members)
- Officers/board (all members with special roles like chapter_chair)
- Chapter manager (non-member admin for events/announcements)

## Core Needs
1. Announcements posting (chapter-wide with media)
2. Events listing (with Cvent registration links)
3. Member directory (searchable with opt-in privacy)
4. Photos sharing (with event association)
5. Admin panel (for content/user management)
6. Profile management (update personal info)
7. Authentication (secure, easy access)
8. Theme options (festive/modern toggle)
9. Notifications system (for events and announcements)

## Technical Approach
- Next.js frontend (React 18) with TypeScript
- Material-UI + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for components
- Convex backend/DB (reactive queries/mutations/actions)
- Authentication via Convex (OAuth, magic links, 2FA)
- Mobile-first, accessible design
- Secure, GDPR-compliant data handling

## Timeline
- MVP: July 28, 2025
- Full Version: August 11, 2025
- Driven by September chapter calendar start
