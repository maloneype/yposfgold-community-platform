# Prototypes Directory

This directory contains prototype code and designs that serve as reference material for our implementation. The code here is not meant to be used directly in the production application but rather as inspiration and guidance for our design and development.

## Contents

### v0 Directory

The `v0` directory contains code generated by [v0.dev](https://v0.dev), Vercel's AI-powered UI generation tool. This code represents initial design concepts for the YPO SF Gold Community Platform.

Original v0 design URL: `https://v0.dev/chat/b/b_LhyeMWE2BaU`

## How to Use These Prototypes

When implementing features or components for the main application:

1. Review the relevant prototype code for design inspiration
2. Adapt the concepts to fit our established project structure and coding standards
3. Implement using our chosen tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, shadcn/ui)
4. Ensure proper integration with our theme system (festive/modern toggle)

## Notes

- Do not copy-paste code directly from prototypes into production
- Use prototypes as reference only, adapting to our project's architecture
- Maintain consistency with our established design system
- Ensure all implemented components are properly typed, tested, and accessible
