# Next Steps for YPO SF Gold Community Platform

## Areas for Improvement

We've identified several areas that need attention to ensure complete conformance with the style guide and technical requirements. These will be addressed in the next development phase:

### 1. Global CSS Integration

- **Move globals.css to the correct location**: Ensure the globals.css file is properly placed in the project structure
- **Import in layout.tsx**: Add the proper import statement in the layout.tsx file
- **Apply CSS variables consistently**: Review all components to ensure they use the CSS variables defined in globals.css
- **Implement theme-specific styles**: Add theme-specific styles for all components using CSS variables

### 2. Font Configuration

- **Configure Next.js font optimization**: Use the Next.js font system to properly load and optimize fonts
- **Set up font fallbacks**: Ensure proper fallbacks are configured for all font families
- **Apply typography consistently**: Make sure typography is consistent across all components and themes
- **Implement font loading strategy**: Use font-display: swap for better performance

### 3. Component Library Consistency

- **Standardize component patterns**: Ensure all components follow the same pattern and style
- **Create component documentation**: Add documentation for all components with usage examples
- **Implement consistent props API**: Make sure all components have a consistent props interface
- **Add accessibility features**: Ensure all components have proper accessibility attributes

### 4. Theme Toggle Integration

- **Add theme toggle to header**: Integrate the theme toggle component into the header
- **Implement immediate theme changes**: Ensure theme changes are reflected immediately across the application
- **Sync with user profiles**: Store theme preferences in the user profile in the database
- **Add theme transition effects**: Add smooth transitions when switching between themes

## Implementation Plan

1. **Day 1: Global CSS and Font Configuration**
   - Move globals.css to the correct location
   - Configure Next.js font optimization
   - Update layout.tsx with proper imports
   - Test theme switching with proper font loading

2. **Day 2: Component Library Consistency**
   - Review and standardize all existing components
   - Create documentation for each component
   - Add missing accessibility features
   - Test components with both themes

3. **Day 3: Theme Toggle Integration**
   - Add theme toggle to the header component
   - Implement theme persistence in user profiles
   - Add smooth transitions between themes
   - Test theme toggle functionality

4. **Day 4: Testing and Refinement**
   - Test all components with both themes
   - Ensure consistent styling across the application
   - Fix any remaining issues
   - Prepare for full version release

## Success Criteria

To ensure complete conformance with the style guide and technical requirements, we will verify that:

1. All components use the correct colors from the style guide
2. Typography follows the specified font families and sizes
3. Component styling adheres to the design specifications (border-radius, shadows, etc.)
4. Theme toggle works correctly and persists user preferences
5. All components are accessible and responsive
6. The application looks consistent across all pages and themes
