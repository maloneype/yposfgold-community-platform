_**Assistant**_

I'll help you launch the development servers. Based on the documentation, we need to start both the Next.js frontend server and ensure Convex backend is running.

First, let me check if we have all the necessary environment variables set up.

---

```bash
ls -la .env*
```

```
paulmaloney@MacBook-Pro-2024 yposfgold-community-platform.com % ls -la .env*
-rw-r--r--@ 1 paulmaloney  staff  620 Jul 17 16:11 .env.local
paulmaloney@MacBook-Pro-2024 yposfgold-community-platform.com %
```

---

Great! We have a `.env.local` file. Let's first install the dependencies:

---

```bash
npm install
```

```
paulmaloney@MacBook-Pro-2024 yposfgold-community-platform.com % npm install
npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine {
npm WARN EBADENGINE   package: 'snakecase-keys@9.0.1',
npm WARN EBADENGINE   required: { node: '>=22' },
npm WARN EBADENGINE   current: { node: 'v21.7.1', npm: '10.5.0' }
npm WARN EBADENGINE }

---

Now, we need to start both the Next.js development server and the Convex development server. According to the documentation, we'll need to run them in separate terminals.

Let's start the Convex development server first:

---

```bash
npx convex dev
```

---

Now, let's start the Next.js development server:

---

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

I've started both servers:
1. The Convex development server (`npx convex dev`) which handles our backend
2. The Next.js development server (`npm run dev`) which serves our frontend

Once both servers are fully started, you should be able to access the application at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Convex Dashboard: The URL should be shown in the Convex server output (typically https://quixotic-clownfish-341.convex.cloud)

A few important notes from the documentation:
1. The application uses Clerk for authentication, which is already configured
2. The environment variables are set in `.env.local`
3. The application includes features like member directory, events system, photos management, and an admin panel
4. Both modern and festive themes are available via the theme toggle

Is there anything specific you'd like to check or test in the running application?
