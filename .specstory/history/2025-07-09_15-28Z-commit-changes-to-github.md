_**Assistant**_

To commit your changes to GitHub, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Initialize a Git Repository (if not already initialized):**
   - Check if your project is already a Git repository by looking for a `.git` folder. If not, you'll need to initialize it.

2. **Add Changes:**
   - Stage the changes you want to commit using `git add`.

3. **Commit Changes:**
   - Commit the staged changes with a meaningful commit message using `git commit`.

4. **Push to GitHub:**
   - Push the committed changes to your GitHub repository.

Let's start by checking if your project is already a Git repository. I'll list the contents of your project directory to see if there's a `.git` folder.

---

It seems there was an issue accessing the directory. Let's try listing the contents of the parent directory to ensure we have the correct path.

| 📄 `.DS_Store` |
| 📁 `_docs` |
| 📁 `.specstory` |
| 📁 `.cursor` |

</details>

---

It seems I attempted to list the contents of a non-existent subdirectory. Let's try listing the contents of the `yposfgold.com` directory again to check for a `.git` folder.

            <summary>Listed directory _docs • **5** results</summary>
        
| Name |

| 📄 `Planning_Checklist.md` |
| 📄 `PRD.md` |
| 📄 `Features_List.md` |
| 📄 `Style_Guide.md` |
| 📄 `Tech_Stack.md` |

</details>

---

It seems I mistakenly listed the contents of the `_docs` directory instead of the main project directory. Let's try listing the contents of the correct directory to check for a `.git` folder.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory .. • **4** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `.DS_Store` |
| 📁 `yposfgold.com` |
| 📁 `tools` |
| 📁 `new-project-video-demo` |

</details>

---

It seems the `yposfgold.com` directory is indeed present. Let's list its contents to check for a `.git` folder.

---

Could not resolve URI: Error: Unable to resolve nonexistent file '/Users/paulmaloney/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/iCloud/RiverTies/development-projects/yposfgold.com/yposfgold.com'

---

It seems there is a persistent issue accessing the `yposfgold.com` directory. Let's try a different approach by checking if the current directory is a Git repository. I'll run a command to check for the presence of a `.git` folder.
